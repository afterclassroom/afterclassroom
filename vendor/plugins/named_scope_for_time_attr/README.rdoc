= Named Scope For Time Attr(ibutes) (nsfta)

http://nsfta.rubyforge.org

== DESCRIPTION:

Provides the ActiveRecord helper method <tt>named_scope_for_time_attr</tt>.  
Given the name of a time attribute of an ActiveRecord model 
(e.g. <tt>created_at</tt> of <tt>Claim</tt>) it defines a correspondent
named scope for easy access to an arbitrarily time range (scope).

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Defines a named scope for the given time attribute
* Allows easy access to an arbitrarily time range
* Defines a named scope <tt>order</tt> for easy ordering of the result

== SYNOPSIS:
	
Define the named scope <tt>created_at</tt> and <tt>last_modified_on</tt>
via <tt>named_scope_for_time_attr</tt>:
	  
  class Claim < ActiveRecord::Base
    named_scope_for_time_attr :created_at, :order => 'created_at DESC'
    named_scope_for_time_attr :last_modified_on, :limit => 10
    ...
  end
  
It is then possible to use the scope method <tt>created_at</tt> and <tt>updated_at</tt>
as follows:
  
    Claim.created_at(2.days.ago)
    Claim.created_at(2.days.ago, 1.days.ago)
    Claim.created_at(:today)
    Claim.created_at(:this_month).order('created_at DESC')
    Claim.created_at(:q1) # quarter one
    Claim.last_modified_on(3.weeks.ago, :limit => 20)
    ...

See API doc for class <tt>named_scope_for_time_attr</tt> for examples:
