          <p class="assDes">Our aim is to provide students with many useful tools to enhance their learning experience as well as user-friendly tools to socialize with their friends either on or off campus.</p>
          <p class="assDes">Currently, we are beginning to provide service to a few select universities/colleges in Canada and the United States. By mid-2011, we plan for all the universities and colleges across North America to have complete access.</p>
          <p class="assDes">After Classroom's mission is to help students succeed in learning.  As a result, we strongly encourage every student out there to feel free and provide us feedback so that we can better serve YOU.  We wish you a wonderful and successful school year!</p>
